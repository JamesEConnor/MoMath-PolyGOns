My name is James Connor, and I am the creator of PolyGOns, part of the Augmented Reality Catergory.

The point of this submission is to capitalize on the recent interest of people, especially kids, in AR games such as Pokemon GO. This was
designed as an implementation for the museum. The basic way it works is, while writing the application, you measure the latitude, longitude,
and alititude coordinates inside the museum. The app then utilizes these points to randomly spawn in polygon creatures that you can battle.
Every time you defeat a creature, it enters into your permanent log journal, so you can show your friends. The goal of this is to help
kids learn that Math not only exists in the things they hate, but in the things the love as well. I also acts as a guide, giving kids the
chance to explore the museum more thoroughly than they would have otherwise.

While a few animations and other niceties may be missing due to time constraints, I really think that this could help to enhance the MoMath
experience. It obviously needs some more work, but I think, with some effort, it would make a great addition to the museum.
